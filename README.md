# Congestion Control for NDN-RTC
## Participants
- Klaus Schneider (University of Arizona)
- Hila Abraham (Washington University of St. Loius)
- Giulio Grassi (University of Pierre et Marie Curie)
- Chngyu Fan (Colorado State University)
- Peter Gusev (REMAP)

## Motivation
Currently, NDN still lacks an effective congestion control mechanism. Moreover, NDN-RTC has known performance problems which may be partly related to congestion. Thus, we try to implement a simple congestion control mechanism in NDN-RTC and show the benefits in a performance evaluation.

## Tasks
- Creating an emulation environment for NDN-RTC (probably mini-NDN)
- Implementing the congestion control
- Evaluating the performance in multiple scenarios
- Presenting the results
