  "body": "# Congestion Control for NDN-RTC\r\n## Participants\r\n- Klaus Sheinder (University of Arizona)\r\n- Hila Abraham (Washington University of St. Loius)\r\n- Giulio Grassi (University of Pierre et Marie Curie)\r\n- Chngyu Fan (Colorado State University)\r\n- Peter Gusev (REMAP)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nCurrently, NDN still lacks an effective congestion control mechanism. Moreover, NDN-RTC has known performance problems which may be partly related to congestion. Thus, we try to implement a simple congestion control mechanism in NDN-RTC and show the benefits in a performance evaluation.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n- Creating an emulation environment for NDN-RTC (probably mini-NDN)\r\n- Implementing the congestion control\r\n- Evaluating the performance in multiple scenarios\r\n- Presenting the results\r\n\r\n",
